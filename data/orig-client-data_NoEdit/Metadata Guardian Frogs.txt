“FrogID”: individual identification number for each individual frog 
“Weight”: mass of the frog in grams
“SUL”: Snout-Urostyle Length in mm, the body length from snout to cloaca of each frog
“Trill”: Trill number, they were numbers consecutively for each recording. If a frog only made three trill (i.e., advertisement calls), then it will have 1, 2, 3 represented in the data sheet
“Pulses”: number of pulses for each of the trills
“PulseRate”: calculated as the number of pulses minus 1 divided by call duration following Bee et al. 2013
“CallDuration”: length of the call, from the onset of the first pulse to the offset of the last pulse in milliseconds
“FundFreq”: measured in Hz
“DomFreq”: measured in Hz
“Call Num”: number of response calls produced by a male, numbered chronologically
“RespTime_sec”: how many seconds passed until a male made a response call after hearing a female call
