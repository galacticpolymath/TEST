  "Text": "#### Driving Question(s):\n- Across animal species, is there truth to the stereotype that males are “competitive,” while females are “caring”, or is this an oversimplification?\n- Are the smooth guardian frogs of Borneo the first known species of frog with “competitive females” and “caring males”?\n#### Essential Question(s):\n- How can we use scientific methods to identify a general pattern?\n- Why do exceptions matter in science and in life?\n#### Learning Summary:\nOut of 8,000+ frog species, Guardian Frogs are one of the first to show females that call & males that care for offspring. Students will gain wonder and appreciation for how diverse animal mating systems are while doing fun activities and analyzing real data.\n#### Hooks\n- Part 1: Highly interactive card-based activity that simulates data collection + amazing animal videos\n- Part 2: Atmospheric videos of Borneo, first person narrative of an early career Latina scientist + use of authentic data \n",

  "Description": "This lesson puts students in the role of scientists, collecting and analyzing real data to answer questions. In Part 1, students \"collect\" data through a card-based activity called \"Role With It.\" Briefly, students get a male or female card of 1 out of 12 species. When their card is called, students introduce it with a \"song\" and dance that match the attributes of the species it represents. The class then records data on sexual signal exaggeration and parental investment for that species. \n\nOnce they have collected all 24 specimens (cards) students analyze this data (for Part 2) to generate a general observation: \"across nonhuman animal species, females tend to be more caring (contributing more parental investment), while males tend to be more adapted to attracting and competing for mates.\" These are known as *conventional sex roles.* Students then identify *sex-role-reversed species,* such as jacanas (a bird) and guardian frogs, which have \"caring males\" and \"competitive females\".\n\nPart 3 lets students use real data to test whether the Smooth Guardian Frog (*Limnonectes palavenensis*) is truly the first known sex-role-reversed frog species, with \"caring males\" and \"competitive females\". The lesson begins with an atmospheric video that immerses students in the sights, sounds, and mysteries of the island of Borneo. Students are then given a brief introduction to the geography of the region and learn that Borneo is claimed by three Asian countries (Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei). The rest of the lesson focuses on Dr. Johana Goyes Vallejos' research in the forests of Brunei. Students test hypotheses by synthesizing information and analyzing a scatter plot to determine that this fascinating species is indeed the first frog known to have \"caring males\" and \"competitive females.\" \n\nThe lesson offers a wide variety of opportunities for student movement, collaboration, creativity, and active engagement.\n"
