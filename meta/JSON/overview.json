  "Text": "#### Driving Question(s):\n- What are crystals and how do they form?\n- How is molecular microstructure connected to functionality and properties we can easily observe?\n#### Essential Question(s):\nWhat are crystals and in addition to being pretty to look at, how are they relevant to our daily lives?\n#### Hook(s):\nAn engaging, original comic weaves together background information, hands-on activities, puzzles, and problem sets. Quick videos stoke curiosity and provide support for activities.\n#### Learning Summary:\nCrystals aren't magic, but they are amazing! In this student-driven, lecture-free lesson, students will do card sorts, build hands-on models, solve engineering design puzzles, and more! The whole experience is connected through a beautifully crafted comic.\nNA",
