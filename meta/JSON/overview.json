  "Text": "#### Driving Question(s):\n- Across animal species, is there truth to the stereotype that males are “competitive,” while females are “caring”, or is this an oversimplification?\n- Are the smooth guardian frogs of Borneo the first known species of frog with “competitive females” and “caring males”?\n#### Essential Question(s):\n- How can we use scientific methods to identify a general pattern?\n- Why do exceptions matter in science and in life?\n#### Learning Objective(s):\n1. Explain how animal behavior facilitates in survival and reproduction.\n2. Collect, reorganize, and analyze data to identify a pattern (that males tend to have adaptations to compete for mates, while females provide more parental care), and interpret exceptions to that pattern.\n3. Understand that biological data are variable.\n4. Learn to test hypotheses by interpreting authentic scientific graphs and data.\n5. Cite evidence to support explanatory claims.\n6. Integrate multiple lines of evidence to explain why exceptions matter in biology and other disciplines.\n\n#### Hooks\n- Part 1: Highly interactive card-based activity that simulates data collection + amazing animal videos\n- Part 2: Atmospheric videos of Borneo, first person narrative of an early career Latina scientist, authentic data \n",

  "Description": "In Part 1, students will be excited to play with cards, dance, and watch short clips of animal courtship behaviors in this gamified, but rigorous activity! Part 2 sets a mysterious atmosphere with an introduction to the sights and sounds of Borneo, and students will interact with real data to follow in the footsteps of a young Latina scientist."
