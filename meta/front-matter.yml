DrivingQ: |-
  - Across animal species, is there truth to the stereotype that males are “competitive,” while females are “caring”, or is this an oversimplification?
  - Are the smooth guardian frogs of Borneo the first known species of frog with “competitive females” and “caring males”?
EssentialQ: |-
  - How can we use scientific methods to identify a general pattern?
  - Why do exceptions matter in science and in life?
LearningObj: |
  1. Explain how animal behavior facilitates in survival and reproduction.
  2. Collect, reorganize, and analyze data to identify a pattern (that males tend to have adaptations to compete for mates, while females provide more parental care), and interpret exceptions to that pattern.
  3. Understand that biological data are variable.
  4. Learn to test hypotheses by interpreting authentic scientific graphs and data.
  5. Cite evidence to support explanatory claims.
  6. Integrate multiple lines of evidence to explain why exceptions matter in biology and other disciplines.

Description: |
  This lesson puts students in the role of scientists, collecting and analyzing real data to answer questions. In Part 1, students "collect" data through a card-based activity called "Role With It." Briefly, students get a male or female card of 1 out of 12 species. When their card is called, students introduce it with a "song" and dance that match the attributes of the species it represents. The class then records data on sexual signal exaggeration and parental investment for that species. Once they have collected all 24 specimens (cards) students analyze this data to generate a general observation: "across nonhuman animal species, females tend to be more caring (contributing more parental investment), while males to tend to focus more energy on attracting and competing for mates. These are known as *conventional sex roles.* Students then identify *sex-role-reversed species,* such as jacanas and guardian frogs, which have "caring" males and "competitive" females.

  Part 2 begins with an atmospheric video that immerses students in the sights, sounds, and mysteries of Borneo. They are then given a brief introduction to the geography lesson and learn that Borneo is claimed by three Asian countries (Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei). The rest of the lesson focuses on Dr. Johana Goyes-Vallejos' research on the Smooth Guardian Frog (*Limnonectes palavanensis*) in the forests of Brunei. Students analyze her actual data to determine if this is the first case of sex role reversal ever described in frogs! The lesson involves a wide variety of opportunities for student movement, collaboration, creativity, and active engagement.

ConnectionToResearch: 'Instead of telling students, "In animal species with *conventional
  sex roles,* males invest more in attracting and competing for mates, while females
  invest more in parental care," we have students collect data in a fun, interactive
  format and draw this conclusion from the data. They are then more invested in understanding
  cases of *sex role reversed species* that are the exceptions to this role, and have
  "caring males" and "competitive females." In part 2, they dive into the hypothesis-based
  framework and follow along in the footsteps of an early career Latina scientist,
  Dr. Johana Goyes-Vallejos. They analyze real graphs and data she collected on the
  island of Borneo to determine if '
