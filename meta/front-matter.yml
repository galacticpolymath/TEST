DrivingQ: |-
  - Across animal species, is there truth to the stereotype that males are “competitive,” while females are “caring”, or is this an oversimplification?
  - Are the smooth guardian frogs of Borneo the first known species of frog with “competitive females” and “caring males”?
EssentialQ: |-
  - How can we use scientific methods to identify a general pattern?
  - Why do exceptions matter in science and in life?
LearningObj: |
  1. Explain how animal behavior facilitates in survival and reproduction.
  2. Collect, reorganize, and analyze data to identify a pattern (that males tend to have adaptations to compete for mates, while females provide more parental care), and interpret exceptions to that pattern.
  3. Understand that biological data are variable.
  4. Learn to test hypotheses by interpreting authentic scientific graphs and data.
  5. Cite evidence to support explanatory claims.
  6. Integrate multiple lines of evidence to explain why biological exceptions matter to science and society.

Description: "This lesson puts students in the role of scientists, collecting and
  analyzing real data to answer questions. In Part 1, students \"collect\" data through
  a card-based activity called \"Role With It.\" Briefly, students get a male or female
  card of 1 out of 12 species. When their card is called, students introduce it with
  a \"song\" and dance that match the attributes of the species it represents. The
  class then records data on sexual signal exaggeration and parental investment for
  that species. Once they have collected all 24 specimens (cards) students analyze
  this data to generate a general observation: \"across nonhuman animal species, females
  tend to be more caring (contributing more parental investment), while males tend
  to be more adapted to attracting and competing for mates. These are known as *conventional
  sex roles.* Students then identify *sex-role-reversed species,* such as jacanas
  (a bird) and guardian frogs, which have \"caring\" males and \"competitive\" females.\n\nPart
  2 dives into fascinating geography, videos from the field, and real data to test
  whether the Smooth Guardian Frog (*Limnonectes palavenensis*) is truly the first
  known sex-role-reversed frog species, with caring males and competitive females.
  The lesson begins with an atmospheric video that immerses students in the sights,
  sounds, and mysteries of the island of Borneo. Students are then given a brief introduction
  to the geography of the region and learn that Borneo is claimed by three Asian countries
  (Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei). The rest of the lesson focuses on Dr. Johana Goyes
  Vallejos' research in the forests of Brunei. Students analyze her actual data to
  test hypotheses by synthesizing information and analyzing a scatter plot to determine
  that this fascinating species is indeed the first frog known to have \"caring males\"
  and \"competitive females.\" \n\nThe lesson offers a wide variety of opportunities
  for student movement, collaboration, creativity, and active engagement.\n"

ConnectionToResearch: Instead of telling students, "In animal species with *conventional
  sex roles,* males invest more in attracting and competing for mates, while females
  invest more in parental care," we have students collect data in a fun, interactive
  format and draw this conclusion from the data. They are then more invested in understanding
  cases of *sex role reversed species* that are the exceptions to this role, and have
  "caring males" and "competitive females." In part 2, they dive into the hypothesis-based
  framework and follow along in the footsteps of an early career Latina scientist,
  Dr. Johana Goyes-Vallejos. They analyze real graphs and data she collected on the
  island of Borneo to determine if the Smooth Guardian Frog (*Limnonectes palavanensis*)
  is the first sex-role-reversed frog species known to science.
